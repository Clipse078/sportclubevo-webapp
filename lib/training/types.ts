/**
 * lib/training/types.ts
 *
 * Public TypeScript types for the canonical Training Foundation and
 * Training Plans (TRAINING-CORE-01 + TRAINING-PLANS-01).
 *
 * These types are the stable public contract for every downstream consumer:
 * Training Planner, Website Weekplanner, Team Pages, Infoboards,
 * Resource Planning, Calendar, Mobile App.
 *
 * Design decisions:
 *   - Dates/timestamps are ISO-8601 strings for easy serialisation.
 *   - startsAt/endsAt are "HH:mm" time-of-day strings, not timestamps,
 *     because a TrainingSeries recurs on weekdays rather than specific dates.
 *   - weekdays uses the Weekday enum (MONDAY … SUNDAY) for readability.
 *   - No resource allocation, weekplans, or publishing fields at this layer.
