/**
 * Returns every eligible TeamSeason (of an active Team) for a tenant, for

 *
 * TEAMCENTER-UX-01C root-cause fix: this previously filtered ONLY by
 * `TeamSeason.status === "ACTIVE"`, with no season-currency constraint at
 * all. Nothing ever flips a TeamSeason's status during a season rollover,
 * so every historical season's TeamSeason for a Team accumulated in this
 * picker forever — a fundamentally different (and staler) selection
 * surface than what the Teams UI treats as canonical/current for that same
 * Team (see lib/teams/current-season.ts). The picker now additionally
 * requires the TeamSeason to belong to the canonical current season, so
 * "Neue Trainingsserie" can never offer a choice that contradicts what
 * Teams/TeamCenter shows as the Team's current season.
 *
 * MASTERDATA-SELECTOR-CONSISTENCY-03 / SEASON-01 root-cause fix: this query
 * is the ONLY canonical current-season consumer that both (a) starts from
 * TeamSeason (not Team) and (b) has zero fallback when nothing matches
 * `Season.isActive` (by design — see lib/teams/current-season.ts, and this
 * must stay that way to preserve PR #342's "never substitute a stale
 * season" protection). Teams/TeamCenter and the TournamentCenter Team
 * dropdown never go empty from a missing current Season because they are
 * Team-centric (a Team still renders even when its `teamSeasons` relation
 * filter matches nothing) and/or fall back to an explicit season key. This
 * picker has neither safety net, so an absent current Season alone makes
 * it render completely empty.
 *
 * SEASON-01: `Season.isActive` used to be silently resynced from calendar
 * dates on every call here (`syncSeasonActiveFlagsWithLifecycle()`) — that
 * was the actual root cause of the STAGE symptom ("no season is currently
 * shown as LÄUFT", empty TrainingCenter selector): the sync could clear
 * every Season's flag (when no Season's dates cover "today") or flip it
 * away from an admin's explicit choice on an unrelated page load. This
 * query now simply reads the persisted, explicitly-set current Season —
 * see lib/seasons/mutations.ts#activateSeason(), the only remaining writer
 * of `Season.isActive`. Once the admin explicitly activates a Season and
 * eligible Teams have a TeamSeason row for it, this picker returns them
 * immediately, with no dependency on visiting the Seasons admin page.
