/**
 * Best-effort in-process sliding-window rate limiter.
 *
 * Classification: BEST-EFFORT — NOT robust distributed rate limiting.
 *
 * Limitations (known and accepted for this slice):
 *   - State is NOT shared across Vercel serverless function instances.
 *     A high-volume attacker can bypass this limiter by distributing
 *     requests across different cold-start instances.
 *   - State is lost on process restart.
 *
 * Why this is retained rather than removed:
 *   - Provides lightweight protection against single-origin burst abuse
 *     even within a single instance lifetime.
 *   - The primary abuse controls are the opaque response design and the
 *     email delivery delay — the rate limiter is additive, not primary.
 *   - Introducing a shared store (Redis/Upstash) solely for this endpoint
 *     is disproportionate without existing infrastructure.
 *
 * Primary distributed protection for auth surfaces is Vercel WAF — see
 * docs/security/vercel-auth-rate-limits.md. Application limits here are
 * defense-in-depth only (not shared across serverless instances).
