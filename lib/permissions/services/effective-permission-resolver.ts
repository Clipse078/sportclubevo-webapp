/**
 * RPERM-03 — Effective Permission Resolver
 *
 * Canonical backend authorization service that determines whether a user holds
 * a specific permission, either at platform level or within a specific tenant.
 *
 * ── Responsibility ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Resolves the union of permissions a user holds by traversing:
 *   UserRole → Role → RolePermission → Permission
 *
 * It enforces:
 *   • Platform vs. tenant scope boundaries
 *   • Exact tenant isolation (Tenant A cannot authorize Tenant B)
 *   • Role and membership validity (archived roles and inactive memberships excluded)
 *   • Fail-closed behavior for all invalid or incomplete authorization paths
 *
 * ── Platform Permissions ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Granted only when ALL of the following hold:
 *   1. The permission has scope = PLATFORM in the database.
 *   2. The user has a UserRole with no tenant context (tenantId IS NULL).
 *   3. The assigned role has scope = PLATFORM and isArchived = false.
 *   4. The role includes the requested permission.
 *
 * Tenant roles NEVER satisfy a platform permission check.
 * A role with scope = PLATFORM but tenantId ≠ null is inconsistent data
 * and must not act as a platform role.
 *
 * ── Tenant Permissions ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Granted only when ALL of the following hold:
 *   1. A valid tenantId is supplied by the caller.
 *   2. The permission has scope = TENANT in the database.
 *   3. The user has an active TenantMembership for that exact tenant.
 *   4. The related Tenant itself is operationally ACTIVE (RPERM-04-C1 — an
 *      active membership linked to an ARCHIVED or INACTIVE tenant grants no
 *      permissions; archival/deactivation must take effect immediately for
 *      every live authorization check, not just at next sign-in).
 *   5. The user has a UserRole scoped to that exact tenant (UserRole.tenantId = tenantId).
 *   6. The assigned role has scope = TENANT, tenantId = requested tenantId, and isArchived = false.
 *   7. The role includes the requested permission.
 *
 * Role ownership is enforced: a TENANT role whose tenantId does not match
 * the requested tenant must not grant permissions in that tenant, even when
 * UserRole.tenantId matches. This guards against inconsistent data.
 *
 * Platform roles do NOT implicitly satisfy tenant operational permission checks.
 * A role membership from Tenant A does NOT authorize access in Tenant B.
 *
 * ── Fail-Closed Behavior ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every method returns false / empty result when:
 *   • The user does not exist.
 *   • No applicable membership or role exists.
 *   • The tenant does not exist or does not match the membership.
 *   • The role is archived.
 *   • The tenant membership is inactive.
 *   • The permission is unknown or scope-incompatible.
 *   • A required tenantId is missing for a tenant-scoped check.
 *
 * Infrastructure failures (database outages, etc.) propagate as exceptions
 * following the repository's existing server-error conventions.
 * They are NEVER silently converted into permission grants.
 *
 * ── Aggregate Method Semantics ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   hasAnyPermission([])  → false   (no permission can be satisfied)
 *   hasAllPermissions([]) → true    (vacuously — all zero requirements met)
 *
 * ── Caching ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * No caching is introduced. Correctness and revocation safety take precedence.
 * Request-scoped memoization may be added in a future RPERM slice.
 *
 * ── Deferred Work ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The following are intentionally NOT part of RPERM-03:
 *   • Roles & Permissions management UI
 *   • Tenant custom-role CRUD
 *   • Broad API route migration to this resolver
 *   • Platform override / super-admin impersonation
 *   • Permission caching infrastructure
 *   • Automatic operational role assignment
 *   • Org-unit / team / target-group permission inheritance
 *
 * ── ADMIN-DELETE-01A-C1 — SCE Super Admin cross-tenant deletion authority ────
 * `hasPermission`/`hasAnyPermission`/`hasAllPermissions`/`getEffectivePermissions`
 * above are UNCHANGED by this correction: a PLATFORM-held permission still
 * never satisfies a TENANT-scoped check through those methods — that rule
 * remains correct for every ordinary "view"/"manage" permission and is the
 * exact bug RPERM-04 fixed.
 *
 * `hasTenantDeletionAuthority()` (below) is a separate, narrowly-scoped
 * authorization primitive reserved for "<module>.delete"-convention
 * permissions only. It adds exactly one additional grant path on top of the
 * existing tenant-scoped one: a user holding a PLATFORM role that carries
 * the same permission key (the SCE Super Admin's platform-wide grant) is
 * authorized against an explicit tenant once that tenant is confirmed to be
 * real and operationally ACTIVE — without requiring a TenantMembership or a
 * tenant-scoped role grant in that tenant. See the method's own doc comment
 * for the full contract and the caller obligations it depends on.
 *
 * ADMIN-DELETE-01A-C2 correction: that platform grant path is resolved via
 * the dedicated {@link resolvePlatformRolePermissionKeys} helper, NOT
 * {@link resolvePlatformPermissions} — every "<module>.delete" Permission
 * row (e.g. teams.delete) is correctly `scope: TENANT` in the database even
 * when attached to the PLATFORM super_admin role, so requiring
 * `permission.scope === "PLATFORM"` (what resolvePlatformPermissions()
 * checks, correctly, for every other permission) made this path permanently
 * unreachable for its own target permission. resolvePlatformPermissions()
 * itself is unchanged and still used, unmodified, by hasPermission()/
 * hasAnyPermission()/hasAllPermissions()/getEffectivePermissions().

   *      are completely unchanged.
   *
   *   2. Platform SCE Super Admin cross-tenant authority — the caller holds
   *      a PLATFORM role (not tenant-owned, not archived) whose
   *      `RolePermission` set includes this SAME permission key — resolved
   *      via {@link resolvePlatformRolePermissionKeys}, NOT

   *      `<module>.delete` key, e.g. `teams.delete` — requiring it to also
   *      be `scope: PLATFORM` would be a data-model contradiction that can
   *      never be satisfied; see prisma/seed.ts, where `teams.delete` is
   *      `scope: TENANT` yet is legitimately attached to the PLATFORM
   *      `super_admin` role). No `TenantMembership` or tenant role is
   *      required — resolved against a tenant that is confirmed to exist
   *      and be operationally ACTIVE. This is the correction: an SCE Super
   *      Admin's platform-held deletion permission is no longer required to
   *      be duplicated as a tenant-scoped grant before it can be exercised
   *      in another tenant.
   *
   * `tenantId` is a REQUIRED, explicit parameter — there is no
   * platform-only ("no tenant context") mode for this method, because
   * deletion is always an operation against one specific tenant's data.
   * Every grant path above still requires resolving that tenant's real,
   * live `status` from the database on every call (never cached) — an
   * unresolved, archived, or otherwise-invalid tenant id is denied even
   * when the caller holds the platform-scoped permission.
   *
   * Caller obligation (never enforced by this method, and NOT satisfied by
   * simply calling it): `tenantId` MUST be derived from a server-side
   * lookup of the entity actually being deleted (e.g. the `tenantId` column
   * on the `Team` row resolved by its own id), never taken directly from a
   * client-supplied request field. Passing an unvalidated client tenantId
   * straight through — even though this method independently checks that
   * the tenant is real and ACTIVE — reintroduces exactly the "blindly trust
   * the client" failure mode the policy forbids, because a malicious caller
   * could simply supply any other real, active tenant's id. Confirming the
   * tenant is real is a floor, not a substitute for resolving it from the
   * target entity server-side.
   *
   * Restricted by convention to "<module>.delete" keys — enforced at
   * runtime by throwing for any other key. This is deliberately NOT a
   * general "platform role implies tenant access" bypass (that would
   * reopen the exact gap RPERM-04 closed for every ordinary permission);
