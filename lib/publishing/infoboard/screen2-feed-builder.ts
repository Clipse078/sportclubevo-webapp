/**
 * lib/publishing/infoboard/screen2-feed-builder.ts
 *
 * Reusable data-composition layer for Infoboard Screen 2 — the FACILITY
 * OVERVIEW ("what is happening on each facility/resource now, and what is
 * next?").
 *
 * Builds InfoboardScreen2Feed by:
 *   1. Calling selectEventsForPublication() with channel INFOBOARD_SCREEN_2
 *      — the exact same publication policy Screen 1 uses (training, HOME
 *      match, HOME tournament; AWAY matches/tournaments are excluded before
 *      this module ever sees them).
 *   2. For each configured pitch, resolving current/next occupancy from the
 *      eligible events whose pitch allocation includes that pitch's code.
 *   3. For each configured dressing room, resolving current/next occupancy
 *      the same way, from the home/away dressing-room allocation codes.
 *   4. Collecting eligible current/upcoming activities that could not be
 *      mapped to any configured pitch into a compact `unallocated` list.
 *
 * Rolling operational horizon (INFOBOARD-INTEGRATION-01C):
 *   Screen 2 reuses the exact same SCREEN1_HORIZON_MS (4 hours) rolling
 *   look-ahead window Screen 1 already defines — imported, never
 *   redefined. For every facility resource:
 *     - current — startAt <= now < effectiveEndAt (no cap).
 *     - next    — the earliest upcoming eligible event for that resource
 *                 starting within the horizon. Only one "next" per resource
 *                 is ever shown (no long future schedule).
 *   `current` and `next` are independent: when a resource has an active
 *   event AND a further upcoming one within the horizon, BOTH are returned
 *   together (Screen 2 shows "JETZT" and "DANACH" side by side) — never
 *   collapsed into an either/or choice.
 *
 * Multi-resource allocations (full-pitch / half-pitch, INFOBOARD-INTEGRATION-01C):
 *   An activity may occupy more than one FacilityResource simultaneously
 *   (e.g. a training using two half-pitch codes at once). Occupancy is
 *   resolved independently per configured resource by checking whether that
 *   resource's code is present in the activity's full allocation code list
 *   (pitchCodes / homeDressingRoomCodes / awayDressingRoomCodes) — so the
 *   same activity correctly appears on every resource it occupies, rather
 *   than being collapsed onto a single card.
 *
 * Design constraints:
 *   - No Prisma imports, no DB access, no Next.js, no React.
 *   - `now` is always supplied by the caller.
 *   - The event loader is called exactly once (delegated to
 *     selectEventsForPublication).
 *   - Publication rules are not duplicated — delegated to PP-01B.
 *   - The rolling horizon constant is not duplicated — imported from
 *     screen1-feed-builder.ts.
 *   - Naming resolution is not duplicated — delegated to the shared
 *     presentation resolvers (Team.name-first canonical naming, identical
 *     to Screen 1).
 *   - Inputs and loaded events are never mutated.
 *   - Result arrays are always new arrays.
