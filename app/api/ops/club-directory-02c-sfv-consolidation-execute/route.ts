/**
 * POST /api/ops/club-directory-02c-sfv-consolidation-execute
 *
 * CLUB-DIRECTORY-02C-EXEC — Temporary, supervised STAGE-only execution
 * endpoint for the ALREADY-REVIEWED FC Allschwil consolidation plan.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SEPARATE ROUTE
 *   scripts/club-directory-02c-sfv-consolidation.ts's `--execute` path
 *   cannot be run locally: it needs live SFV credentials
 *   (SFV_TOKEN_URL / SFV_APPLICATION_KEY / SFV_APPLICATION_PASS /
 *   SFV_CLUB_ID), which are Vercel Sensitive Production environment
 *   variables and cannot be pulled in plaintext. Those credentials ARE
 *   configured on the deployed STAGE runtime. This route is a narrowly
 *   scoped, temporary way to run exactly one supervised execution there,
 *   after a human has already reviewed the read-only dry-run
 *   (GET /api/ops/club-directory-02c-sfv-consolidation?mode=dry-run) STAGE
 *   result. It is intentionally a SEPARATE file from that read-only route —
 *   the read-only route continues to export GET only and remains
 *   structurally incapable of ever mutating anything (see its own module
 *   doc); this file is the only place `POST` (and therefore any mutation)
 *   is reachable, and it is expected to be deleted once this one supervised
 *   run has happened.
 *
 * REUSE — NO DUPLICATED MUTATION LOGIC
 *   This route performs NO merge/archive/move decision of its own. It:
 *     - reuses `resolveTenantContexts` / `resolveProviderClubIdIndex` /
 *       `loadTenantInventoryFromIndex` / `buildTenantPlan`
 *       (scripts/club-directory-02c-sfv-consolidation.ts) to regenerate the
 *       plan, exactly like the read-only dry-run does;
 *     - reuses `computePlanFingerprint`
 *       (lib/club-directory/plan-fingerprint.ts) — the SAME pure helper the
 *       read-only route's dry-run response now also exposes — to compare
 *       the freshly regenerated plan against the operator-pinned one;
 *     - reuses `buildBackupSnapshot` (scripts/club-directory-02c-sfv-consolidation.ts)
 *       for the pre-mutation backup contents, persisted durably via
 *       `persistConsolidationBackupSnapshot` (lib/club-directory/ops-backup-storage.ts);
 *     - reuses `consolidateExternalClubsByProviderIdentity`
 *       (lib/club-directory/consolidation-service.ts) through the exact
 *       same Prisma adapter (`createClubConsolidationDatabase`,
 *       lib/club-directory/prisma-consolidation-adapter.ts) ordinary sync
 *       and the CLI's `--execute` path use — the ONLY function in the
 *       codebase that ever writes to ExternalClub / ExternalTeam /
 *       ExternalClubProviderMapping for this feature.
 *   No new mutation code path is introduced anywhere.
 *
 * WHY `consolidateExternalClubsByProviderIdentity` DIRECTLY, NOT
 * `runSfvClubConsolidationForTenant` (TOCTOU ANALYSIS)
 *   `runSfvClubConsolidationForTenant()` (lib/integrations/sfv/sync/club-consolidation.ts)
 *   fetches SFV's team-list/ranking data ITSELF before calling the
 *   consolidation service. Calling it here — AFTER already regenerating and
 *   fingerprinting the plan via a first SFV fetch — would perform a SECOND,
 *   independent SFV fetch for the mutation itself. Between those two
 *   fetches SFV data could change, so the identity map actually executed
 *   against could silently drift from the exact map the fingerprinted,
 *   operator-approved plan was built from — a time-of-check-to-time-of-use
 *   (TOCTOU) gap. This route closes that gap by fetching SFV EXACTLY ONCE
 *   per request (`resolveProviderClubIdIndex`) and passing that SAME
 *   `providerTeamId -> providerClubId` index straight into
 *   `consolidateExternalClubsByProviderIdentity` through its Prisma
 *   adapter, instead of calling `runSfvClubConsolidationForTenant` (which
 *   would ignore the already-fetched index and fetch SFV again).
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT GUARD — STAGE ONLY
 *   Rejects with 403 on every environment except STAGE (`APP_ENV=stage`,
 *   see lib/env.ts#getRuntimeEnvironment), checked BEFORE authentication.
 *
 * AUTHENTICATION
 *   Requires an authenticated SCE platform operator with the existing
 *   platform-only `tenants.manage` permission. Routine `CRON_SECRET` is never
 *   accepted.
 *
 * FIXED TENANT
 *   Operates ONLY on the hard-coded tenant key `fc-allschwil` — the request
 *   body is never read for a tenant identifier at all.
 *
 * POST ONLY
 *   Only `POST` is exported. There is no GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE handler.
 *
 * EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION + PLAN-FINGERPRINT PINNING
 *   The JSON body MUST contain:
 *     { "confirmation": "CONSOLIDATE-CLUB-DIRECTORY",
 *       "expectedPlanFingerprint": "<sha256 hex from the reviewed dry-run>" }
 *   Both checks happen BEFORE any tenant/SFV/database access. The plan is
 *   then regenerated live (never trusting the caller-supplied JSON as
 *   execution input) and re-fingerprinted; if it does not EXACTLY match
 *   `expectedPlanFingerprint`, the request aborts with zero mutations. This
 *   is also what makes a repeated request after a successful run safe: once
 *   consolidated, the regenerated plan's group set is empty/different, so
 *   its fingerprint no longer matches the originally-reviewed one and the
 *   second call aborts before touching anything (idempotent no-op).
 *
 * BACKUP BEFORE MUTATION
 *   See lib/club-directory/ops-backup-storage.ts. No mutation is attempted
 *   unless the backup was durably persisted first.
 *
 * FAILURE SAFETY / CREDENTIAL HYGIENE
 *   Every guard above runs, in order, before any SFV/DB access; any failure
 *   up through and including the pre-mutation backup returns
 *   `mutationStarted: false` — mutation is guaranteed to not have started.
 *   All error responses are sanitized generic messages — no DATABASE_URL /
 *   SFV_* / CRON_SECRET value, and no raw internal error message, is ever
 *   included in a response body.
 *
 * MID-EXECUTION FAILURE IS REPORTED EXPLICITLY, NEVER AS A GENERIC ERROR
 *   `consolidateExternalClubsByProviderIdentity` commits one transaction PER
 *   duplicate group (see its own module doc) — it is not one atomic
 *   transaction across every group. If it (or the read-only postcondition
 *   check right after it) throws, groups already processed before the
 *   throw may already be committed. Returning the same generic 500 used for
 *   pre-mutation failures here would let an operator mistake "some groups
 *   may already be merged" for "nothing happened" and re-run destructively.
 *   Instead, once execution reaches this point, any thrown error is caught
 *   separately and reported as:
 *     { "error": "Consolidation execution failed after mutation processing started.",
 *       "mutationStarted": true, "partialCompletionPossible": true,
 *       "backup": { "pathname": "..." },
 *       "nextAction": "Run a fresh inventory and dry-run before retrying." }
 *   The already-persisted backup's pathname is always included so the
 *   operator can inspect/restore from it. No exact per-group progress is
 *   reported — this is a one-time operational endpoint, not a job-tracking
 *   system; the operator is simply told to re-run inventory/dry-run before
 *   ever retrying `--execute` again.
