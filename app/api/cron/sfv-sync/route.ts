/**
 * GET /api/cron/sfv-sync
 *
 * SFV-MATCH-SYNC-HOTFIX-01 — Phase B: automatic SFV synchronization.
 *
 * Vercel Cron entry point. Triggers an automatic, tenant-scoped SFV schedule
 * sync for every tenant with an enabled TenantSfvConfig, reusing the exact
 * same canonical sync service used by the manual admin "Sync now" button
 * (syncSfvSchedule via runAutomaticSfvScheduleSync — no second sync
 * implementation).
 *
 * Scheduling (see vercel.json "crons"): every 30 minutes UTC.
 * Match/schedule data is operational club information; this cadence keeps SFV
 * fixtures from staying stale for up to a day between syncs.
 *
 * Overlap safety: runAutomaticSfvScheduleSync claims a per-tenant TTL lock
 * before syncing; overlapping cron invocations skip locked tenants. syncSfvSchedule
 * is idempotent (upsert on externalMatchId, unchanged short-circuit).
 *

 * Authorization:
 *   - Requires `Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}`. Vercel automatically
 *     attaches this header to scheduled invocations of routes configured in
 *     vercel.json's "crons" array when the CRON_SECRET environment variable
 *     is set on the project.
 *   - If CRON_SECRET is not configured server-side, every request is
 *     rejected (fail closed) — this endpoint must never run unauthenticated.
 *   - This route is never linked from, or called by, any public page or
 *     client-side code. No browser ever polls SFV directly or indirectly
 *     through this route. Ordinary public page requests never trigger it.
 *
 * Security invariants:
 *   - SFV credentials remain server-side (read from process.env inside
 *     lib/integrations/sfv/client.ts only) — never accepted from, or
 *     returned to, the caller.
 *   - The response body is the sanitized SfvAutoSyncSummary — no
 *     credentials, tokens, or raw provider payloads.
 *   - Manual admin-triggered sync (POST /api/admin/integrations/sfv/schedule/sync)
 *     is entirely unaffected by this route and continues to work independently.
