/**
 * GET /api/cron/sfv-club-master-import
 *
 * CLUB-DIRECTORY-05-C1 — automatic SFV club master import.
 *
 * Vercel Cron entry point. Triggers an automatic, tenant-scoped SFV club
 * master import for every tenant with an enabled TenantSfvConfig, reusing
 * the exact same canonical import service previously exposed by the manual
 * admin "SFV-Vereinsverzeichnis synchronisieren" button
 * (runSfvClubMasterImport via runAutomaticSfvClubMasterImport — no second
 * import implementation).
 *
 * Product decision: tenant admins must never trigger this manually — see
 * CLUB-DIRECTORY-05-C1. This cron route is now the only way the import
 * runs. It intentionally runs on its own once-daily schedule, entirely
 * independent of the SFV match/schedule sync cron
 * (app/api/cron/sfv-sync/route.ts) — never coupled to, or invoked from,
 * that route or its orchestrator.
 *
 * Scheduling (see vercel.json "crons"): once daily at 04:00 UTC ("0 4 * * *").
 * Club master/reference data changes infrequently; daily import is sufficient.
 * Scheduled a few hours after the match/schedule sync cron to spread provider
 * load — the two crons do not depend on each other and either may run, succeed,
 * or fail independently of the other.
 *
 * Authorization:
 *   - Requires `Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}` — identical pattern
 *     to app/api/cron/sfv-sync/route.ts. Vercel automatically attaches this
 *     header to scheduled invocations of routes configured in vercel.json's
 *     "crons" array when the CRON_SECRET environment variable is set on the
 *     project.
 *   - If CRON_SECRET is not configured server-side, every request is
 *     rejected (fail closed) — this endpoint must never run unauthenticated.
 *   - This route is never linked from, or called by, any public page or
 *     client-side code, and is not reachable from the admin UI.
 *
 * Security invariants:
 *   - SFV credentials remain server-side — never accepted from, or
 *     returned to, the caller.
 *   - The response body is the sanitized SfvAutoClubMasterImportSummary —
 *     no credentials, tokens, or raw provider payloads.
