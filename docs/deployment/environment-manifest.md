# Canonical Environment Manifest

This is the canonical names-and-scopes manifest for the web application. It
contains no deployable values. Environment values remain in the approved
deployment platform or an operator-approved local secret store.

Scope terms:

- **Production** means a canonical deployed runtime, including the dedicated
  STAGE project's Vercel Production scope and the production project.
- **Preview** means a feature-branch deployment. Preview is intentionally
  credential-poor.
- **Local** means developer or isolated test execution.
- **Conditional** means required only when the named feature or operation is
  enabled.
- **Forbidden** means the variable must not exist in that scope.

## Development and break-glass

Database variables repeated in this category retain the stricter Database table
rules: `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` and `TEST_DATABASE_URL` are local-only and forbidden
in every deployed runtime scope.

| `FCA_CLUB_ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD` | Temporary legacy FCA club-admin bootstrap credential | Yes | Forbidden | Forbidden | Conditional | One approved bootstrap only | Bootstrap refuses the relevant write | FCA-specific and temporary; not a Tenant #2 pattern |

## Preview policy

Preview is intentionally credential-poor. It may build and deploy while runtime
features requiring credentials remain unavailable. Operators must not copy
shared STAGE secrets into Preview to make those features work.

Preview must not receive shared STAGE values for:

- `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`, or any direct/test/shadow database URL
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` or `AUTH_SECRET`
- `CRON_SECRET`
- `SFV_APPLICATION_KEY`, `SFV_APPLICATION_PASS`, or `SFV_CLUB_ID`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- Resend API keys or webhook secrets
- Blob read/write tokens or store bindings
- OPS backup credentials or store bindings
- `PUBLIC_WEBSITE_REVALIDATION_CONFIG`
- migration, seed, permission-sync, or password-change flags
- bootstrap, recovery, or diagnostic credentials

Benign shared configuration may include `APP_ENV`, `APP_BASE_URL`,
`NEXTAUTH_URL`, `EMAIL_FROM`, and `EMAIL_INBOUND_DOMAIN`. Platform encryption of
these settings does not make them secrets.

When a Preview deployment intentionally uses the persistent STAGE database for
native billing acceptance (invoice PDF, Swiss QR section, email attachment
generation), `SCE_BILLING_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must also be present in the **Preview**
Vercel environment scope with the **same** value as the STAGE **Production**
scope. Vercel does not inherit Production-scoped secrets into Preview
deployments automatically.

## Production policy

- Canonical STAGE/production deployments receive only the operational
  credentials required for enabled runtime features.
- `APPLY_DATABASE_MIGRATIONS` must never be Preview-scoped.
- Bootstrap/recovery password or hash variables must not persist in Vercel
  runtime scopes.
- Test and shadow database URLs must not exist in any deployed runtime scope.
- Shared STAGE credentials must never be copied into Preview.

## Current deployment evidence

The manually verified post-C1 Vercel metadata state is names/scopes-only:

- Production-only privileged names: `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`,
  `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `CRON_SECRET`, the four `SFV_*` names, the three Resend
  secret names, all public/Workspace Blob names, all OPS backup names, and
  `APPLY_DATABASE_MIGRATIONS`.
- `PUBLIC_WEBSITE_REVALIDATION_CONFIG` is absent from Preview and from the
  current metadata listing.
- Preview retains only the benign/config names `APP_ENV`, `APP_BASE_URL`,
  `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `EMAIL_FROM`, and `EMAIL_INBOUND_DOMAIN`.
- A fresh credential-poor Preview reached Ready; runtime features requiring
  omitted credentials remain intentionally unavailable.

This document records policy and verified metadata only. It does not authorize
environment changes.
