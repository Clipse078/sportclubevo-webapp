## Current v1.0 Release Focus

The current active focus is delivering the **Website ↔ WebApp Integration** and finalising the **Planner foundation**, running in parallel toward the FC Allschwil production go-live.

For detailed feature status, see [`sportclubevo-v1-master-backlog.md`](./sportclubevo-v1-master-backlog.md).

---

## Agreed Execution Sequence

The following ordered phases define how v1.0 will be delivered. Each phase must be in a production-quality, stable state before the next phase begins unless explicitly noted as parallel work.

### Phase 1 — STAGE Recovery ✅

**Goal:** Establish a clean, trusted, drift-free development baseline.

- `STAGE` branch verified and declared source of truth
- Anti-drift workflow documented and enforced (AGENTS.md)
- Branch naming convention established (`cursor/<name>-fc79`)
- Deployment pipeline confirmed stable on Vercel

**Status:** Complete

---

### Phase 2 — Organisation Builder Foundation ✅

**Goal:** The core data model for clubs, teams, people, seasons, and roles is in place and fully operational.

- `OrgUnit`, `OrgUnitMembership`, `TargetGroup` models and admin UI
- `Person`, `Team`, `TeamSeason`, `PlayerSquadMember`, `TrainerTeamMember` models and admin UI
- `Season` management
- `Role`, `Permission`, `UserRole`, `RolePermission` RBAC system
- Four-eye governance workflow (`RoleWorkflowRule`, `RoleWorkflowReviewAssignment`)
- Registration workflow (Probetraining, Spieleranmeldung, Traineranmeldung, Sponsoranfrage, Kontaktanfrage)
- Tenant branding architecture (`logoUrl`, `primaryColor`, `secondaryColor`, CSS variables)
- Audit logging (`AuditLog` model)
- Impersonation support
- **Org Builder Foundation v1 (2026-06-25):** `archivedAt` timestamp on `OrgUnit`; archived units view with tab toggle; `OrgUnitRestoreButton`; `POST /api/org-units/[id]/restore` endpoint; `getArchivedOrgUnits` query; `EmptyActive`/`EmptyArchived` states. Migration: `20260625000000_org_unit_archived_at`.
- **Organisation-based Permissions Foundation (2026-06-25):** `ActorContext.orgUnitIds` wired to real visibility and access rules; `loadOrgUnitIds()` now excludes archived org units; `canAccessOrgUnit()` / `canManageOrgUnit()` / `canListOrgUnits()` helpers in `lib/visibility/org-unit-access.ts`; org-unit detail and history pages grant read access to active members of each specific unit; RESTRICTED entity visibility checks (`canSeeEntity()`, `buildVisibilityWhere()`) fully activated for Meetings, Initiatives, Targets via `visibleOrgUnitRefs`.

**Status:** Largely complete — see Current Platform Status in `sportclubevo-v1-master-backlog.md` for precise per-item status

### Phase 3 — Website Management Foundation ✅ (largely)

**Goal:** The editorial content system is built and the content lifecycle (draft → review → published) is operational.

- Meetings, Initiatives (Vereinsleitung)

**Status:** Largely complete

- Full publishing pipeline for all content types (news, teams, matches, events, week plan, sponsors)

**Status:** Planned

---

### Phase 8 — Mobile Backend Foundation

**Goal:** The API layer for the mobile application is production-ready, secure, and multi-tenant.

- Mobile authentication (separate token flow)
- Parent-child relationship model
- Attendance API (create, update, query per player per event)
- Event participation API
- Team calendar API

**Acceptance criteria:**
