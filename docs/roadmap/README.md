## Navigation Guide

**New to the project?** Start with `00-product-blueprint.md` to understand what SportClubEvo is and why it exists.

**Planning work?** Use `01-roadmap.md` for the execution sequence and `sportclubevo-v1-master-backlog.md` for feature-level status.

**Preparing for go-live?** Work through `02-go-live-checklist.md` section by section.

**Found a technical debt item?** Add it to `03-technical-debt.md`.

**Making an architectural decision?** Add an ADR to `05-architecture-decisions.md`.

**Thinking about a post-v1 feature?** Add it to `08-post-v1-ideas.md` — do not add it to the v1 backlog.

## Backlog Source of Truth

`sportclubevo-v1-master-backlog.md` is the **detailed backlog source of truth**.  
It contains the complete feature list, status for every item, priority, release target, and the living progress checklist.  
All other documents in this folder reference it — they do not duplicate it.
